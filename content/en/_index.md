      The APEC Lab at Sun Yat-sen University focuses on the physiological ecology and conservation of terrestrial animals, especially reptiles and birds. Our research integrates field and controlled experiments with mechanistic and statistical models to explore how animals interact with their environment. By studying physiological responses and ecological dynamics, we assess species’ adaptability and vulnerability to environmental change. Our work aims to enhance biodiversity conservation by bridging experimental research with predictive modeling.

        Random Matrix Optics

        Random matrix optics introduces the random matrix toolbox to the representation of light wave-particle duality. Starting in 2019, our group focused on light field representation, decomposition, detection, and manipulation using the random matrix representation. Random matrix representation provides a statistical gating strategy for different components in the light field. For example, the single and multiple scattering component in wide-field reflective imaging; the ballistic and multiple scattering component in spectral-domain OCT. The gated multiple scattering component facilitates the calculation of absorption information for in-vivo tissue imaging.
